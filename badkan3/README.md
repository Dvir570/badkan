# Badkan 3.0

## Goals
* Simplify the use of the Badkan for the instructors in particular for the create exercise process.
* Improving the UX of the platform.

## Comparison to similar system
The website of automated checking used by Ariel university at: http://31.154.73.187/cgi-bin/welcome.cgi

* Badkan allows users to submit entire programming projects through github and source folder;
* Badkan is dynamic: allowing account management, submission visualization from the website and at the real time...;
* Badkan is easy to use for every user (beginner or expert).

## Main use cases
1. All the use cases of the Badkan 2.
1. Making the grading system private or public.
1. See the available exercises.
1. Help to create exercise.
1. Submission via GitHub or via a source folder.

## 1. Making the grading system private or public.
Badkan allows instructor to choose if they want to share their grading system. That is, any instructor can take the exercise of another instructor and obtain all the files for the grading system.  

Thus, each instructor can either learn how to write a grading system by using others instructor's grading system, or customize the exercise as he wants to.

## 2. See the available exercises.
Each instructor could see all the "public" (see use case 1) exercises of the platform. The search must be efficient: the instructor can as example search only for java exercises or hard exercises.

## 3. Help to create exercise.
If an instructor has no time (or anything else) to program the grading system, but he want to create a particular exercise, Badkan allows the instructor to write a message (from the website) explaining the purpose of the exercise, and a programmer of the team Badkan will implement the grading system for the instructor.

## 4. Submission via GitHub or via a source folder.
Badkan allows submission either via a GitHub link, or via a source folder. The grading should remain the same.
